# Predicting Loan Defaults with Machine Learning

The aim of this project was to build a machine learning model that can predict whether or not a borrower was able 
to pay off his or her loans. The data in this project came from Lending Club which is a marketplace for personal 
loans that matches borrowers with investors.
